Welcome to FitCount!

FitCount is an in-development, simple iOS/watchOS app aimed at fitness facilities that want to reward their members for working out hard in their facility. When activated FitCount will track the user's location and heart rate. Then, whenever the user is in their gym they will earn points added to their FitCount whenever their heart rate goes above a threshold. These points will be redeemable at their fitness facility for stuff...and things too!

More information coming very soon, stay tuned!
